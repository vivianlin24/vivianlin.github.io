Hello! My name is Vivian, and I am a Data Science Major with a Business minor at the University of California, San Diego. I became a data scientist because I love converting numbers into actionable information. Making data-driven decisions is the smartest thing a company can do at every level, whether it be operations, supply chain, or consumer marketing, and I want to contribute to a team that makes that possible. My resumè is available upon request. Please take a look around to see the internships and leadership positions I've held, as well as projects I have completed!

## My Projects
<p id="Projects">
<strong>k-NN Regression Prediction Model: League of Legends</strong>
  <br>
  <br>
    <a href="League_of_Legends_Project.pdf" class="button" target="_blank">Click Here to See!</a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li>Built a k-Nearest Neighbor model to predict the winning team of a League of Legends game based on the champions selected and statistics from the first 15 minutes of a game and a basic logistic regression classifier as the baseline model</li>
    <li>Achieved a model accuracy of just over 80% through hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering</li>
  </ul>

<strong>Classification Prediction Model: NYPD Civilian Complaints</strong>
<br>
<br>
    <a href="NYPD_Civilian_Complaints_Project.pdf" class="button" target="_blank">Click Here to See!</a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li>Constructed a binary classification model to predict whether a civilian’s complaint to the NYPD will be addressed or not </li>
    <li>Performed feature engineering to provide the model with more help features and increase the accuracy of the predictions </li>
    <li>Developed a fairness analysis using permutation tests to assess potential bias for male vs. female-identifying complainants </li>
  </ul>
