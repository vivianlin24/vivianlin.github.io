Hello! My name is Vivian, and I am a Data Science Major with a Business minor at the University of California, San Diego. I became a data scientist because I love converting numbers into actionable information. Making data-driven decisions is the smartest thing a company can do at every level, whether it be operations, supply chain, or consumer marketing, and I want to contribute to a team that makes that possible. My resumè is available upon request. Please take a look around to see the internships and leadership positions I've held, as well as projects I have completed!
